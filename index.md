I am a graduate of Computer Science. My research interests are in the area of High Perfomance Computing. I have used paralell programing paradigm such as Multi-threading, MPI, OpenSHMEM and CUDA-GPU.
Computational Science at <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/" target="_blank">Middle Tennessee State University</a>.
My advisor is <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/faculty/abdul-khaliq" target="_blank">Dr. Abdul Khaliq</a>. My research
interest is on Data-driven deep learning algorithms for differential equation models. My codes will be on github
at <a href="https://github.com/andela-bomotoso" target="_blank">https://github.com/okayode</a>. My work involves finding
efficient numerical Solutions of partial differential equations and systems, parameter estimation and inverse
problems. Presently, I am working on epidemiological models for an infectious disease such as COVID-19, with data
from the publicly accessible
<a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
" target="_blank">COVID-19 data</a>. We proposed that mitigations such as governmental actions and public responses,
forces the model parameters to become time series. In our approach, we do not need to explicitly specify the
time-dependent model parameters, instead we learn these parameters by defining them to be outputs of multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) that are connected to a larger MLP that predicts the solution to the epidemiological model.
We consider when there is a spatial structure in the model and when there is none.

I am also interested in the discovery of governing equations of reaction-diffusion models such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo
equations with nonlocal diffusion. In these models, the data-driven approach is able to detect nonlinear diffusion term
from experimental data.
